This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(CNEr)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(rtracklayer)
```

```{r}

cneFiles <-  list.files("/mnt/orca/projects/AQUA-FAANG/species/CNEs/",
                        pattern = "RDS", full.names = T)

names(cneFiles) <- str_match(cneFiles, "Salmon_(.+)\\.RDS")[,2]
cneClass <- lapply(cneFiles, readRDS)

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
